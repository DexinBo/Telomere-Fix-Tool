This script is a comprehensive and optimized tool designed to identify and replace telomeric or repetitive regions at the ends of multiple contig sequences within a FASTA file. It leverages the powerful MUMmer suite for sequence alignment and Biopython for sequence manipulation, all while employing parallel processing for efficiency.

Key Features and Improvements ðŸš€
This final version of your script incorporates several significant enhancements:

Parallel Processing: It uses Python's concurrent.futures module to process multiple contigs simultaneously, dramatically speeding up execution on multi-core systems.

Intelligent Alignment Selection: Instead of just using percentage identity, it now employs a combined scoring strategy (identity multiplied by alignment length) to select the "best" alignment for replacement, ensuring more biologically meaningful results.

Custom Replacement Logic: It precisely implements your desired replacement strategy: replacing a contig's end with the entire relevant portion of the consensus sequence (from its start to alignment end for the 5' side, or from alignment start to its end for the 3' side).

Robust Dependency Checking: It verifies the presence of required external MUMmer tools before starting, preventing runtime errors.

Clean Operation: Uses temporary directories to manage intermediate alignment files, automatically cleaning them up upon completion.

Multi-Sequence Support: Handles FASTA files containing multiple contigs (reference) and multiple consensus sequences (query), iterating through each.
